# desktop-Clinic
The clinic project is controlled by the admin in adding patients , doctors and modifying their data, and the doctor can be permanently deleted from the clinic. The doctor can see , modify the patientâ€™s medical history, and he cannot be deleted from the system. The one who is able to delete him is the admin.  I used Java, My SQL, JDBC library, and MySQL Connector.

#note
you should link the mysql with project
you should create store produre in mysql with the same name of project 
you should install JDBC and sql connector and link it with project
